# Eventus

Sequential, disk-backed event store database built in Rust.

## Credits

This project is a heavily modified fork of [commitlog](https://github.com/zowens/commitlog), which helped provide a very useful backbone to the storing of events. The segment based architecture was inspired by [AxonServer](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-server).
